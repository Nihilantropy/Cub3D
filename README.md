## 🎨 How Our Raycasting Works

### 📐 The Math Behind It
Let's break down how we actually implemented raycasting in our  function:

1. For each screen column, we calculate a ray:
   - The camera position transforms the screen x-coordinate (-1 to 1)
   - We combine the player's direction with the camera plane
   - This gives us our ray direction into the game world

2. Our magical DDA (Digital Differential Analysis) algorithm:
   - First, we figure out the step size (how far we move in x and y)
   - Then we calculate initial distances to the first grid lines
   - We keep stepping through the grid until we hit a wall!

### 🎥 Rendering the 3D View
The cool part happens in our render_walls function:

1. Wall Height Magic:
   - We use the perpendicular distance to avoid that fisheye effect
   - Calculate wall height based on distance (closer = taller)
   - Center the walls vertically on screen

2. Texture Mapping:
   - We figure out which part of the wall we hit
   - Pick the right texture (North, South, East, West)
   - Add a neat shadow effect for walls hit on the sides

## 🎮 Game Features

### 👾 Player Movement
- Move with W, A, S, D keys
- Look around with left/right arrow keys
- Press ESC to quit
- Smooth window management included!

### 🏃‍♂️ Game Loop Implementation
Our game runs in a smooth loop that:
1. Handles player input
2. Updates the game state
3. Renders the new frame
4. Maintains consistent timing

## 💡 Cool Implementation Details

### 🌟 Special Effects
- Different wall textures for each direction
- Floor and ceiling colors
- Distance-based shading
- Proper perspective correction

### 🔧 Performance Tricks
- Smart use of DDA for quick ray calculations
- Efficient texture mapping
- Frame timing control for smooth movement
- Careful memory management

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Building the Project
- Use the provided Makefile
- Compile with -Wall -Wextra -Werror flags
- Link with MinilibX and math libraries

### Map Creation Rules
- Maps must be closed/surrounded by walls
- Only one player starting position
- Invalid maps should return an error
- Spaces are valid in maps!

## 🎨 Bonus Features Ideas
Want to make your Cub3D even cooler? Try adding:
- Wall collisions
- A minimap system
- Opening and closing doors
- Animated sprites
- Mouse look control

## 🎯 Key Challenges & Solutions
Common challenges you might face:
- Texture alignment issues? Check your wall hit calculations!
- Movement feeling off? Double-check your delta time!
- Walls looking weird? Make sure you're using perpendicular distance!

Remember: The goal is to create a smooth, immersive 3D experience from a 2D map. Take it step by step, and don't forget to handle those edge cases! 🎮✨

Happy coding! 🚀
